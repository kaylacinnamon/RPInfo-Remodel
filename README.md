# RPInfo-Remodel

What will the working prototype be?

- A representation of the project you've been working on (proposal, schedule, use cases)
- It will probably not be a fully developed version of your product
- It should be developed well enough that you can show it in class and walk us through some typical uses
- I should get a good sense of how the final product will look, feel, and operate
